    <h1>INSIGHTS: EXCITEMENT AND CHALLENGES IN WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
    <h1>INITIAL IMPRESSIONS</h1>
    <p>As I step into this course, my initial feelings are a mix of nervousness and eagerness. To be honest, my knowledge of HTML and JavaScript is quite basic, and that does make me a little anxious. But here's the thing – it's that very mix of fear and excitement that draws me in.</p>
    <p>Sure, I might not be a coding wizard right now, but the idea of learning and mastering these languages, of being able to create web content that's interactive and dynamic, that's what truly piques my interest. The thought of crafting web experiences that come to life, responding to users' actions and inputs, well, that's like a puzzle waiting to be solved. It's the challenge, the thrill of gaining this new skill set, and the creative possibilities that have me both anxious and excited to embark on this journey.</p>
    <h1>A WEBSITE OR WEB APPLICATION I ADMIRE <span class="heart">&#9829;</span></h1>
    <p>Well, there are many websites and apps that I love but among them, YOUTUBE is at the top. Its user-friendly interface boasts a prominent search bar for effortless video exploration. Personalized recommendations on the homepage draw users in, while visually appealing thumbnails and titles simplify content discovery.</p>
    <p>It has such a robust search engine, delivering precise results even if it is niche queries. Features like likes, comments, and subscriptions foster vibrant online communities. The 'Up Next' feature makes users engaged, creating an addictive browsing experience. Mobile apps, accessibility options, and monetization tools for creators make YouTube more than just a video platform; it is a digital haven, exemplifying excellence in web design and user engagement.</p>
    <h1>CHALLENGES AND STRATEGIES</h1>
    <p>As I begin this course, I'm aware that the biggest hurdle I'll face is within myself. My prior exposure to JavaScript and HTML, although present, has been quite limited. While I delved into them last semester and even created a website, I leaned heavily on the support of my professor, friends, and online resources.</p>
    <p>To tackle this challenge head-on, my strategy is clear. I'll be dedicating myself to regular coding exercises, seeking help from my professors and peers whenever needed, and making the most of the abundance of online resources available.</p>
    <h1>PAST PROJECT AND STRATEGIES TO SUCCEED</h1>
    <p>I recall a past assignment that might seem simple to others but was a significant learning experience for me. It involved creating a digital clock using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, which, at the time, felt like climbing a mountain with no gear.</p>
    <p>What really made a difference were my professor's efforts in ensuring everyone understood the basics of these languages. My friends played a crucial role, offering guidance and support. Online resources were my lifeline, providing valuable insights. This experience taught me the importance of seeking help when needed and utilizing available resources to conquer new challenges.</p>

    <h2>MY LAST WEEK EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <p>Last week I did not have enough time to continue my coding journey journal, so here today I want to talk about last week also. Usually, I struggle to stay engaged and awake during coding sessions. But this time something was different. Perhaps it was the teaching style of our professor, Ben, or maybe it was group work, but I found the experience not just bearable but genuinely enjoyable.</p>
    <p>The most interesting part of last week was collaborating with friends to create simple webpages. We worked on projects like crafting a recipe card, designing a travel destinations page, and creating an "About Us" page. During these projects, I learned about the fundamental aspects of HTML, the structure of an HTML page, including attributes, elements, headings, paragraphs, and HTML entities. It was like discovering the building blocks of the web.</p>
    
    <h2>THIS WEEK EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <p>This time the class was all about advanced HTML. I learned about forms, tables, media elements, semantic elements, meta tags, accessibility, and SVG graphics. Among these, I want to talk more about semantic elements. Before this, I didn't know about the importance of semantic elements. For one thing, this helps Google bots understand your page better, and should thus help increase your page’s ranking and relevance according to Google’s algorithms. A lot of it is structural (in terms of page layout and content hierarchy).</p>
    <p>Another vital aspect of semantic elements is their role in code sustainability. They act as markers, reminding both developers and collaborators of their intended use. This not only aids in maintaining the code but also facilitates the process of finding and updating specific sections of a codebase.</p>
    <p>Additionally, semantic elements provide precision in targeting elements with CSS. Instead of struggling to style generic tags, semantic elements allow for more meaningful and precise styling based on their structural significance within the page.</p>

    <h2>DIFFICULTIES</h2>
    <p>Over the past weeks, we faced challenges that I found invigorating. This week's assignment was more demanding, but the effort was worth it. I used all available resources to understand the class topics, especially enjoying exploring Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) and semantic elements.</p>
    <p>In hindsight, these experiences transformed my view of coding.</p>

    <h2>IMPORTANCE OF WEBSITE’S RESPONSIVENESS</h2>
    <p>
        Responsive web design is not a program; instead, it uses only HTML and CSS to make your web page look good on all devices. It is important as it can help solve a lot of problems for the website. It will make our site more mobile-friendly and improve the way it looks on different devices with both large and small screens. With these benefits, it helps increase the amount of time visitors spend on our site and improves the website’s rankings in search engines.
    </p>

    <h2>HOW I OVERCAME SOME DIFFICULTIES</h2>
    <p>
        This week, I found myself stuck quite a few times, particularly when it came to CSS. It was a mix of both easy and difficult. However, as I started learning, I gained a much better understanding of concepts like margin, padding, z-index, the box model, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements. This newfound knowledge really helped me get a grip on the styling aspect of web development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, this week at Free Code Camp was incredibly productive for me. I used to rely on a straightforward method of committing and pushing my code directly from Visual Studio Code to publish it on my GitHub account. But with the guidance of fantastic mentor Maddy, I learned how to use Git more effectively. Now, I can confidently use Git commands to manage my code and repositories. It has been a significant change for me, and I am grateful for the opportunity to expand my skills in this area. These experiences have taught me that seeking help and learning can always be a good way to overcome any difficulties.

    <h2>MODERN WEB DESIGN TRENDS</h2>
    <p>
        Among the trending modern web design trends, two of them stood out the most to me. The first one is DARK MODE and the second is WHITE SPACE. As for the Dark Mode, on the practical end, they help reduce eye strain, a concern for many as we are spending more and more time looking at screens. On the aesthetic end, dark mode easily creates an ultra-modern look for our website while giving us the ability to highlight other design elements just by darkening the elements that surround it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of white space is about giving content room to breathe, not trying to cram the most information possible on the screen. The experience is more relaxing for our website visitors, the content stands out better, and readability is improved.
    </p>
    <p>
        White space is just the term for the spacing we give between elements. It does not have to be white, as long as the area is empty.

    <h2>How I approach the task of coding something completely new or unfamiliar.</h2>
    <p>
        So, this is how I learn the task of coding something new or unfamiliar. I always begin with a sense of curiosity. Along the way, there are moments of challenges and hiccups, but that is all part of the journey I embrace. I make sure to celebrate even the tiniest victories, like cracking a tough problem or crafting a neat piece of code. What's amazing is that as I continue to explore, I discover that reaching out to ask for help and collaborating with fellow learners transforms my learning into a delightful, shared experience. So, I keep my persistence, maintain an open mind, and never forget to have fun with the code. Staying updated with the latest tech trends and best practices keeps my coding journey fresh and exciting.

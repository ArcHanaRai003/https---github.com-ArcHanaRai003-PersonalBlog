            <h2>Fun Facts About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hey there! I'm Archana Rai, but you can call me Munna; that's my nickname. I'm 20 years young and excitedly awaiting my 21nd birthday this January.
                My journey begins in the picturesque hills of Nepal, specifically Sankhuwasabha, where I've had the pleasure of growing up. These hills hold many stories and adventures!
                I completed my educational journey at Koshi Saint James, conquering high school with zest.
                Currently, I'm on my exhilarating second semester at Ulsan College, diving headfirst into the world of IT.
                Now, here's the fun part—I'm a language enthusiast! I speak not just one, not two, but four languages! Basic Korean, English, Hindi, and, of course, my mother tongue, Nepali.
                Let's talk tech—I've ventured into the realms of C, HTML, CSS, and even tamed the beast called Excel!
                But wait, there's more! I'm currently exploring the intriguing worlds of databases and Linux systems. I'm also honing my presentation skills and taming the JavaScript dragon.
                And as if that's not enough excitement for one lifetime, I've embarked on a mission to master the Korean language with TOPIK classes. It's safe to say there's never a dull moment in my life, and I'm loving every bit of this thrilling journey!
